# Introduction

The Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT) is a research project led by the University of Leeds and funded by the Department for Transport (DfT).  The purpose of CyIPT is to develop methods and tools to assist in the design and planning of new cycling infrastructure.

CyIPT was funded by the Innovation Challenge Fund (ICF) to demonstrate the readiness of technology to automate the early stages of the planning process for cycling infrastructure --- scheme evaluation.
The aim was to:

> tackle the challenge that cycling uptake is often limited by infrastructural barriers which could be remediated cost-effectively, yet investment is often spent on less cost-effective interventions, based on assessment of only a few options.

This aim builds on the work already on the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) to estimate the *potential* for cycling uptake nationwide .
[@departmentfortransport_national_2016].
The PCT does this by analysing origin-destination data on travel patterns to identify trips that could be replaced by cycling nationally, down to the route-network level [@lovelace_propensity_2017].
While the PCT focusses on *where* to prioritise a core cycling network, CyIPT focusses on *what* to build and *when*, in terms of prioritisation.

# Method

# Results

## The CyIPT workshop

# Next steps

During the final months of the CyIPT project and following the successful CyIPT workshop plans for follow-on work are in motion.
It seems there is high demand for the type of interactive evidence on infrastructure options provided by CyIPT and there are many options for taking the project forward.

## Feedback {-}

CyIPT is a publicly accessible research project based on open source software, the results of which are available in an online map-based tool at [www.cyipt.bike](https://www.cyipt.bike) (currently password protected).

The code underlying CyIPT is hosted on GitHub, a platform for software development and collaboration that also provides and excellent forum for discussing issues and providing feedback as follows:

- Feedback on CyIPT Results and Methods: [github.com/cyipt/cyipt/issues](https://github.com/cyipt/cyipt/issues) 
- Feedback on CyIPT website and user interface: [github.com/cyipt/cyipt-website](https://github.com/cyipt/cyipt-website/issues)

Hosting the code on GitHub also enables community contributions.
If you find any issues on this user manual, for example, suggested changes to the source code are welcome [here](https://github.com/cyipt/cyipt-website/edit/master/man/index.Rmd), which requires a GitHub username from [github.com](https://github.com/).

Alternatively we welcome your feedback at info@cyipt.bike.
