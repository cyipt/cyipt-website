The purpose of CyIPT is to develop methods and tools to assist in the design and planning of new cycling infrastructure. CyIPT is currently (as of March 2018) a working prototype. Therefore, any recommendations produced by CyIPT should be subjected to independent assessment before making investment decisions. "],

It seems there is high demand for the type of interactive evidence on infrastructure options provided by CyIPT and there are many options for taking the project forward. Feedback CyIPT is a publicly accessible research project based on open source software, the results of which are available in an online map-based tool at www.cyipt.bike (currently password protected). The code underlying CyIPT is hosted on GitHub, a platform for software development and collaboration that also provides and excellent forum for discussing issues and providing feedback as follows: Feedback on CyIPT Results and Methods: github.com/cyipt/cyipt/issues Feedback on CyIPT website and user interface: github.com/cyipt/cyipt-website Hosting the code on GitHub also enables community contributions. If you find any issues on this user manual, for example, suggested changes to the source code are welcome here, which requires a GitHub username from github.com. Alternatively we welcome your feedback at info@cyipt.bike.
